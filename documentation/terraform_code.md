#   Terraform code
Certainly! Below is a simple example of Terraform code for deploying an AWS S3 bucket. This assumes you have the AWS CLI configured with the necessary credentials.

```

# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1" # Set your desired AWS region
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name"
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Name        = "MyBucket"
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}` 
```
In this example:

-   The `provider` block configures the AWS provider with the desired region.
-   The `resource` block defines an AWS S3 bucket named `my_bucket`. You should replace `"my-unique-bucket-name"` with a globally unique name for your bucket.
-   The `acl` attribute sets the access control list for the bucket. In this case, it's set to "private," but you can adjust it based on your requirements.
-   The `tags` attribute allows you to add metadata to your resources, making it easier to manage and identify them.

Remember to run `terraform init` and `terraform apply` after creating your Terraform files to initialize your working directory and apply the configuration.

This is a very basic example, and Terraform can manage a wide range of infrastructure resources on different cloud providers. You can extend your Terraform configurations to include networking, security groups, EC2 instances, databases, and more.

Make sure to check the Terraform documentation and provider-specific documentation for more advanced use cases and best practices: [Terraform Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html)
